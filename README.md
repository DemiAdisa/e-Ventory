# e_ventory

A Social Media app which is created using Flutter for the frontend and Firebase for the backend.  
Its UI is fairly similar to instagram but with different features.  
In this app, you are only allowed to post pictures about clothing items you have in your wardrobe.  
This requires a level of image labelling and detection and is implemented using Firebase ML Kit
